## Frontend Setup (`hackerbot-command-center`)
The frontend is built with Vite and requires Node.js and npm.

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd hackerbot-dashboard/
npm install
```
> **Note:** If you see warnings related to Node.js versions, ensure you have Node.js 20 or later installed.

### 2. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev -- --host
```
This will start the frontend server. By default, it runs at:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```
